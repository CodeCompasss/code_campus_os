System Identity and Branding Files
/etc/lsb-release (edit or replace, contains distribution info)

/etc/os-release (edit, changes distro and version details)

/etc/issue and /etc/issue.net (remove or edit pre-login system messages)

/boot/grub/grub.cfg and /boot/grub/loopback.cfg (edit boot menu branding)

.disk/info (edit, changes live CD identity)

README.diskdefines (edit, changes CD README info)

Visual and Logo Branding
/usr/share/icons/ubuntu* and /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/ubuntu* (remove Ubuntu icons)

/usr/share/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo (remove Ubuntu boot splash themes)

/usr/share/backgrounds/ubuntu*.jpg or /usr/share/backgrounds/ (replace Ubuntu wallpapers)

/usr/share/images/ (search for branding images)

/usr/share/doc/ubuntu* (remove Ubuntu-specific documentation)

Installer/Live System
Ubiquity and related installer packages: /usr/share/ubiquity/ (replace installer graphics, strings, logos)

Casper live boot files: /usr/share/casper/ubuntu.png or similar (boot logo)

/usr/lib/os-release (same as /etc/os-release on some setups)

Default User and System Scripts
Change default live user "ubuntu" in live build scripts or /etc/passwd

Look for system scripts referencing Ubuntu by name (customize scripts for your branding)

URLs, Documentation, and Help
System-wide references to "ubuntu.com" URLs (/etc/apt/sources.list, /usr/share/doc)

Application help menus or about dialogs referencing "Ubuntu" or Canonical

Any application splash screens or dialogs with branding

Additional Removals
Remove any leftover packages named ubuntu-* unless needed for functionality

Clean up /etc/apt/sources.list to point only at your own or generic repositories, not archive.ubuntu.com
